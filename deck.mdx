## 🚀👩‍🚀 Discovery Day 11/13/2020 👨‍🚀🚀

## Mission: Explore Next.js (a React framework)

# React ⚛

#### A JavaScript framework that helps us build faster with:

##### 🧱♻️ Reusable blocks called components ♻️🧱

##### 🧠 Internalized and portable logic 🧠

##### ✨ Nice abstractions for keeping UIs up to date when things change ✨

---

# Why a React Framework?

#### There are still many decisions to make:

##### ❓ Routing library ❓

##### ❓ File system organization ❓

##### ❓ Data fetching ❓

---

# Routing

## How users navigate within an application 🧭

##### What happens when you click on [links]() and browser buttons like ◀️ and ▶️ ?

##### How should we handle dynamic routes like `/things/432521`?

---

# File System Organization

##### Well organized projects make development intuitive 🙌

##### Less organized projects make development difficult 😖

##### Maybe this could be part of the framework so we don't need to think about it?

---

## Routing and the file system work hand in hand 🤝

pages/signals/[id].js → https://www.sampleapp.com/signals/512

# Data Fetching

### When do we request data from outside sources? 🤔

##### Once when the application is built and deployed?

##### Every once in a while?

##### Every time?

---

# The good news...

### Next.js lets us to customize behavior on a _per page basis_

**Static Generation (Ideal)** → Once when the application is built and deployed

**Server Side Rendering (Less ideal)** → Every time

Static generation is the default behavior in Next.js 🏎️

---

# Example Traffic Signals App

**About** - No data fetching needed

**All Traffic Signals** - Fetch data from database at build time

**Individual Traffic Signals** - Fetch data from database at build time

---

<CodeSurfer themes={[vsDark, nightOwl]}>


```js title="About Page /about/"
// This page will be pre-rendered into HTML at build time.
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js title="All Traffic Signals /signals/"
// The page component receives signals prop
// from getStaticProps at build time
export default function Signals({ signals }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Signals</h1>
      <ul>
        {signals.map((signal) => (
          <li key={signal.id}>{signal.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  )

// This function runs at build time on the build server
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      signals: await getSignalsFromDatabase()
    }
  }
}
```

```js title="Individual Traffic Signals /signals/[id]"
// Return the list of ids of signal pages (/signal/[id])
// that will pre-render at build time
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const signals = await getSignalsFromDatabase();

  const paths = signals.map((signal) => ({
    params: { id: signal.id },
  }));

  return { paths };
}

// params will contain the id for each generated page.
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  return {
    props: {
      signal: await getSignalFromDatabase(params.id),
    },
  };
}

export default function Signal({ signal }) {
  // Render signal
}
```

### What if you want something in between?

**Incremental Static Generation**

- All the benefits of static generation
- Set `revalidate` parameter to refetch data and update static pages
- Future requests will contain latest and greatest data

---

<CodeSurfer>


```js 20:20 title="Adding Incremental Generation to getStaticProps()"
// The page component receives signals prop
// from getStaticProps at build time
export default function Signals({ signals }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Signals</h1>
      <ul>
        {signals.map((signal) => (
          <li key={signal.id}>{signal.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  )

// This function runs at build time on the build server
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      signals: await getSignalsFromDatabase(),
      revalidate: 60
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeSurfer>


---

### What if you want something in between?

**Client Side Rendering**

- Pre-render static content in a component
- Hydrate pre-rendered component with data request from user's browser
- Provide latest and greatest data to a static component

---

<CodeSurfer>


```js title="Client Side Rendering"
import useSWR from "swr";

function WorkOrderQueue() {
  // fetchAPI is the function that fetches data
  const { data, error } = useSWR("/api/queues", fetchAPI);

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>;
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>;
  return (
    <div>Work Orders in Queue: {data.queue.length}</div>
  );
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

# Cool things about Next.js

- Great developer experience
  - Built-in file organization that ties directly to app routing
  - Fast Refresh
- Default to static generation but can deviate on a per page basis
- Default to static generation for fast applications

---

# Trade-offs of Next.js

- Learning curve for using file structure to create routes
- Create React App v4 includes Fast Refresh
- Need to think carefully about how you want app to behave
